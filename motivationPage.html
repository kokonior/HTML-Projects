                <h3>
                    There are a lot of ingredients that go into creating a consistent exercise program—having goals, being prepared, being
                    disciplined, and staying committed. But one of the most important, and sometimes most elusive, is motivation.
                    
                    We often wait for the motivation to exercise, thinking one day we'll wake up and it'll be there. What's true for many of
                    us, however, is that the motivation to work out is the strongest in the planning phase since most of us are working for
                    some future goal, like losing weight.
                    
                    When you're planning a future workout, you're probably relaxed, rested, and feeling good, maybe visualizing yourself
                    going through a workout and being successful. But when the alarm goes off at 5 a.m., or when you're driving home after a
                    long day of work? That motivation is nowhere to be found.
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h2>What Is Motivation?</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    Motivation can be defined in very simple terms: what drives us to maintain or achieve goals. One might even say it is a
                    form of desire.
                    
                    When you look at it that way, things change a bit, at least for many of us. Yes, you should exercise, you need to
                    exercise, you want to want to exercise, but do you have a desire for exercise?
                    
                    For some people, maybe—they like how it feels to exercise. But, for many of us, exercise is usually thought of as having
                    one end goal—helping you to lose weight, look better, get strong, feel better, be healthy, stave off diabetes, etc.
                    
                    That's a little different than wanting to exercise, which is why so many of us run into that brick wall. We set goals,
                    we make plans, maybe we even stick with those plans for a while. But then we may find that motivation fading and wonder
                    what we're doing wrong.

            <h2>Types of Motivation :-</h2>
            <h3>
                It's important to know where your motivation comes from and that there are a couple of different types of motivation.
                There are external things that motivate you and then there are internal desires that drive you.
            </h3>
            <br>    
                <h2> 1.Extrinsic Motivation :</h2>
                <h3>
                    This kind of motivation is what we usually rely on when it comes to exercise. It's kind of like the carrot and the stick. You try to lure yourself into a workout with the carrot ("You'll lose weight!") or by hitting yourself with an invisible stick ("You'll get fat if you don't work out!").
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h2> # Other external motivators include: </h2>
                <h3>
                <p>. Looking good in a bathing suit</p>
                <p>. Losing weight for a high school reunion</p>
                <p>. Getting flat abs</p>
                <p>. Wanting to fit into old jeans</p>
                <p>. Trying to get back to the weight you were in college</p>
                <p>. Wanting to look good for your spouse or loved one</p>
                </h3>
            <br>
                <h2> 1.Intrinsic Motivation :</h2>
                <h3>
                There's another type of motivation that comes from within. This is something important to you, not some future goal, but
                something you can get right now.Some examples of intrinsic motivation include:
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    <p>. Exercising because it feels good</p>
                    <p>. Loving that runner's high feeling</p>
                    <p>. Working out because it relieves stress</p>
                    <p>. Feeling good when your body gets stronger and you can do more than you did before</p>
                    <p>. Enjoying exercise because it gives you time to think or zone out</p>

                <h2>Why Aren't We Motivated to Exercise?</h2>
                <h3>
                    There are lots of reasons we may not be as motivated to exercise as we used to be. Some of these things are actually
                    barriers or obstacles we have to overcome, such as:
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    <p>. <b>Sedentary jobs and lifestyles:</b> Most of us spend much of our day on the computer and in the car, meaning less walking and
                    more sitting. The more we sit, the more we get used to sitting, and the harder it is to get the body moving.</p>
                    <p>. <b>Being overweight:</b> If you're overweight, it's harder to exercise. You might have physical issues like joint pain or
                    injuries and it's hard to move a larger body, making exercise more intimidating and uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>. <b>Busy lifestyles:</b> We are busier than ever and that becomes a great excuse to skip exercise.</p>
                    <p>. <b>Stress:</b> While exercise is supposed to reduce stress, exercise is also a kind of stress on the body. If you feel stressed
                    out, working out may be the last thing you want to do, even though it's probably the best thing for you.</p>
                    <p>. <b>Neighborhood safety:</b> If you have safe places to walk, run, or cycle, you're much more likely to do so, especially if you
                    see other people doing the same thing.</p>
